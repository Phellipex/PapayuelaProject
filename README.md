### INTRODUCTION ###

This project was born as step in my HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript self-learning journey. Its purpose is to serve as a playing ground for testing newly learned concepts. HOwever, it is also intended to be useful for non-programmers who can benefit from it (i.e. translators).

### OVERVIEW ###
The Papayuela Project is a set of four tools for performing translation-related calculations. Often translators need to know how much a given number of words will cost, how many words there are in a text segment, how long a transaltion will take at the current pace (translated words per day), etc. This tool intends to solve that.

### REQUIREMENTS ###

This tool has the following dependencies:

* Twitter Bootstrap 3 and above
* A JavaScript-enabled modern browser

No internet connection is required. Also, no servers are required either as the application runs entirely on the client side.

### INSTALLATION ###

This is a no-brainer: simply download the package provided in the downloads section, unzip it and open the index.html file.

### CONTRIBUTING ###
Any suggestions are welcome.
